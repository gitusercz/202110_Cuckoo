# Cuckoo-clock

This is a simple python script that takes the folder "Sounds" next to itself . Every minute it checks if there is a matching folder in HHMM format. 

For example at half past 8 in the morning it looks for a folder "0830". Az 8 PM it looks for a folder "2000". 

If there is such a folder it plays the mp3 file that is in there. 

**Put only one file in the folder and do not have any spaces in the name**

In this uploaded example the chime sounds are from [BBC's open sound effects library.](https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/) 

If the python script is set to be autostarted on power up, with a loudspeaker you can have a Cuckoo-clock.
